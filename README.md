# swiftnote
一个 [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) theme，用于网站 [swiftnote](https://www.swiftnote.io/)

最近开始学 swift ，然后搞个小网站来记录学习中遇到的问题。

##预览：

##特性：
主要是两点：
- 集成了搜索
- 自定义错误页

##CopyRight

- 模板基于 [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) 定制
- 代码高亮基于 [hilight.js](highlightjs.org) + [Solarized Light](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
- 搜索基于 [jQueryHunter](https://github.com/jamalneufeld/ghostHunter) 目前只支持英文搜索，对于技术类网站，差不多够了
